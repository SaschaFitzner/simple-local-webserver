# SIMPLE LOCAL WEBSERVER

**Author Sascha Fitzner - fitznerIO**

"simple-local-webserver" is a simple yet powerful tool for setting up a local web server. This application is built on Node.js and provides a compact and straightforward solution for developers who need a local testing environment.

## Usage
The project provides two key npm scripts for starting and building the application:

`npm start`: This script starts the web server on your local system. It utilizes the server.js file to initialize the server. It serves static content from the "public" directory and makes it accessible on port 4400. Additionally, it opens a new browser window automatically for your convenience.

`npm run build`: This script is used to compile the application into an executable file format that can be run on Windows systems with Node v18. The compiled program is named simple-local-webserver.
